**CHOIR** (**c**lustering **h**ierachy **o**ptimization by **i**terative **r**andom forests) is a clustering algorithm for single-cell data. CHOIR applies a framework of permutation tests and random forest classifiers across a hierarchical clustering tree to statistically identify clusters that represent distinct populations.
